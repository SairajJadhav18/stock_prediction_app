## SAIRAJ JADHAV, 

## Stock Return Prediction Dashboard

This project is an interactive stock analysis dashboard that I built to use machine learning and historical price data to analyze short term stock trends. The goal of the project is not to predict exact prices, but to interpret directional signals, uncertainty, and confidence in a way that is clear and honest.

The dashboard is built using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas, and supports stocks from multiple countries and markets.

## Explanation of what my project does

This dashboard allows a user to:

Select stocks or ETFs from different markets

Run a machine learning model on demand
Visualize historical price trends
Identify peaks and drops in stock prices
View model performance metrics
See which features mattered most to the model

Understand confidence through a speedometer style gauge

The focus is on interpretability and clarity, not overconfident predictions.

## Various Markets and Stock Option + You can add more 

The dashboard currently supports:

US Stocks
MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, META, NVDA, NFLX

Canadian Stocks
SHOP, RY, TD, BNS, BMO, ENB, CNQ, CP, CNR, SU

Indian Stocks
RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS, INFY.NS, HDFCBANK.NS, ICICIBANK.NS, SBIN.NS, HINDUNILVR.NS, ITC.NS, LT.NS, BHARTIARTL.NS

Canadian ETFs
XIU.TO, VCN.TO, VFV.TO, XIC.TO, ZCN.TO

## Why I picked the Machine learning approach

The model is designed to predict next day return direction, not exact price.

Feature engineering includes:
Daily returns
Lagged returns (1 day, 2 day, 5 day)
Moving averages (5 day and 10 day)
Short term volatility
Day of week effect
Target
Next day return direction
Model output
Mean Absolute Error
R2 Score
Directional Accuracy

Directional accuracy is used as a key input for interpretation and confidence.

## Price trend visualization

The dashboard includes an interactive line chart showing:

Historical closing prices

Detected price peaks (local highs)

Detected price drops (local lows)

## Model interpretation section

Instead of making hard predictions, the dashboard includes a plain language 
interpretation written so that it is easy for even beginners to understand

The interpretation is based on:

Recent price movement
Model directional accuracy
Market volatility

The outlook is categorized as:

Bullish
Bearish
Uncertain

Each category explains:

What the data is showing
Why the model leans that way
Why uncertainty still exists


## Confidence meter (speedometer style)

To visually communicate uncertainty, the dashboard includes a speedometer style confidence gauge.

The confidence score is calculated using:
Model directional accuracy
Recent volatility
Whether signals agree or conflict

The gauge shows:

A score from 0 to 100
Color zones for low, medium, and high confidence
A clear visual indicator instead of false precision

## Dashboard structure

The dashboard is built using Streamlit and includes:

Market selection
